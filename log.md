# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 30, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Interview Cake Problems with queue and stacks
- Written in pseudoclassical instantiation
  - #19
    - using 'this.length && this.length--;'
    - pushing and popping between two stacks
    - traversing through queue with node implementation using next pointers
  - #20
    - max stack was a composition problem i.e. max stack 'has' a stack, but does not 'inherit' from it

TDD on problems using ava

**Thoughts** 
- Implementation in queues using array, object, or nodes/linked lists
- Using data structures within data structures (used in get max value in stack)
- Stacks = LIFO
- Queues = FIFO
